# Market_Basket_Analysis

## Introduction

Another exciting topic in marketing analytics is Market Basket Analysis, which can be approached using different algorithms. In this publication, I will compare the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms. I will start by introducing key terms and metrics to help understand what “association” in a rule means, as well as methods to quantify the strength of these associations. Then, I will demonstrate how to generate these rules from the 'Groceries' dataset using both the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms.

## Data Description

For this post, the [Groceries dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heeraldedhia/groceries-dataset) is used, which can be found on popular data platforms like Kaggle. You can also download it from my “GitHub Repository.”

## Market Basket Analysis

Market basket analysis is frequently used by restaurants, retail stores, and online shopping platforms to encourage customers to make more purchases in a single visit. This is a use-case of data science in marketing that increases company sales and drives business growth and commonly utilizes the Apriori algorithm.

## Apriori Algorithm

The Apriori Algorithm widely uses and is well-known for Association Rule mining, making it a popular choice in Market Basket Analysis Python. AI and SETM algorithms consider it more accurate. It helps to find frequent itemsets in transactions and identifies association rules between these items. 

The Apriori algorithm has three main components:

- Support

-	Confidence

-	Lift

## FP- Growth Algorithm

A Frequent Pattern Tree is a tree structure that is made with the earlier itemsets of the data. The main purpose of the FP tree is to mine the most frequent patterns. Every node of the FP tree represents an item of that itemset. The root node represents the null value, whereas the lower nodes represent the itemsets of the data. While creating the tree, it maintains the association of these nodes with the lower nodes, namely, between itemsets.

## Association Rule

Association rules are calculated from itemsets, which are made up of two or more items. If rules are built from analyzing all the possible itemsets, there could be so many rules that the rules hold little meaning. With that, association rules are typically created from rules well-represented in data.

## Conclusion

Both the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms are effective for Market Basket Analysis. Apriori is simpler but can be slower for large datasets, while FP-Growth is more efficient by using an FP-tree structure. Businesses can use these methods to identify item associations and improve sales strategies, with FP-Growth often being the better choice for handling large datasets.
